# S&P 500 Price Movement Prediction Using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project predicts whether the S&P 500 index will close higher or lower the next day using logistic regression on technical indicators derived from historical price data.

## Motivation
Predicting short-term stock movements is a challenging problem in finance. This project explores how classic technical indicators combined with a simple machine learning model can provide meaningful insights into market direction.

## Data Source
- Ticker: ^GSPC (S&P 500 Index)  
- Source: Yahoo Finance via `yfinance`  
- Period: January 1, 2020 â€“ July 31, 2025

## Features
Includes daily returns, moving averages, momentum indicators, volatility measures, RSI, MACD, and lagged returns.

## Model Performance Summary
The logistic regression model achieves around **56% accuracy**, outperforming random guessing. It is better at predicting upward price movements (with higher recall and F1-score) but struggles to identify downward movements, indicating potential class imbalance or room for improved feature engineering.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install required Python packages, e.g.:  
   ```bash
   pip install yfinance pandas ta scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `sp500-prediction.ipynb` for full analysis, model training, and detailed evaluation
